# Get Started

- from business-master (whatever the name of this project you cloned) run this on the terminal

- cd server - to switch to server directory
- npm i - to install server dependencies

- open another terminal
- cd client - to go to client directory
- npm i - to install client dependencies




- i accidentally commited without message and close the editor as soon as I noticed it, then after opening it again I saw a .git folder with a file inside named COMMIT_EDITMSG. now i will try to commit this (2nd cm) if that file actually tracks my commit messages (it would be cool if it is!)

- update, it is gone now (.git) it actually tracks the add readme msg but after closing, it disappears entirely.
